# TopUp-QR-Services
This is a new version of the QR Code Top-Up Services
CameraX Library is now replaced with Zxing Library to scan and decode the barcode.
Current Issue faced: 
*Camera not working TopUp.java class and qrscanner.java class is not reading.
*Therefore, unable to tell if a qr code can be scanned form the application.

Firebase:
Application has been connected to firebase realtime database to try and store value of qr code that will be scanned.

Project timetable: 1 Week remaining.
